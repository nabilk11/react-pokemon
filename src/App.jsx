// step 1 added state with useState, added two default pokemon in just for testing "bulbasaur" "charmander"
// pokemon is the data that we will need setPokemon is the method to update the state
// step 2 import PokemonList and added it to the App, also added the prop for pokemon so it can get the pokemon data
// see pokemon list.jsx for additional steps for rendering list and adding pokemon prop
// next step installed and imported axios for api call - using it to make api call from pokemon api
// making api call with axios and using that to setstate
// then we need to remove the example pokemon from the useState back to an empty array
// importing useEffect - each time something happens and we want to rerender our application when it does happen
// the effect in this case is the api call 
// must add an empty array to the last argument in useEffect in order to prevent it from rerendering
// useEffect will continuously run each time one of these arguments change, an empty array will not change so it will only render once
// moved axios api call into the useEffect function
// created state array for changing page urls, passed the api url into the useState and set axios.get value to currentPageUrl
// also moved currentPageUrl into the empty array in useEffect - this means that everytime the currentPageUrl changes,
// then the useEffect will run again, and perform the axios api call for the new currentPageUrl
// adding change of next and previous page url to our axios api call withing the useEffect function
// this will change the data based on the properties of next and previous given to us from the api using res.data.next/previous
// adding a loading versus not loading state - to display a loading screen
// added condtional statement to show if loading is true, on slower internet for isntance, it will show text
// adding cancel token from axios - this will cancel older requests before a new request is being made
// this ensures no older data is being loaded as the new data is being requested
// need to pass new cancel token into get request and call cancel() function to return at the end of our useEffect
