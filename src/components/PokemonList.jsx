import React from 'react';

export default function PokemonList() {
  return (
  
  <div>

  </div>
  )
}

// passed in the prop of pokemon into the PokemonList function because thats the data we want to provide to the App when we export
// instead of using { pokemon } as the prop we could use props
// then we could put props.pokemon right under it - because its only just pokemon we can put that straight into where we would have the prop
